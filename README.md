2. Start Angular server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Application runs on `http://localhost:4200`

## Development

Both servers must be running:
- Backend API on port 8080
- Frontend on port 4200

Access the application at `http://localhost:4200`

## Tests
This project includes three levels of testing:

  - Unit and integration tests for the backend using JUnit 5,
  - Unit and int√©gration tests for the frontend using Jest,
  - end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress.

### Backend

To run tests :

  ```bash
  cd back
  mvn clean test
  ```

To generate coverage report :

  ```bash
  mvn jacoco:report
  ```
  The coverage report file is available on `.../back/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Frontend

To run tests :
  ```bash
  cd front
  npm run test
  ```

To generate coverage report :
  ```bash
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```

The coverage report file is available on `.../front/coverage/jest/lcov-report/index.html`

### e2e

To run live tests and open the Cypress graphical interface : 
  ```bash
  cd front
  npm run cypress:open
  ```
This command opens the Cypress GUI. 

The front server must be running.

In the interface :
